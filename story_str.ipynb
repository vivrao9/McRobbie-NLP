And the same is true at universities all over the country, as their collective might is now turned squarely towards this grave problem. As Dr. Harvey Fineberg, a former president of the National Academy of Medicine, put it just a few days ago, the ultimate goal of the nation's research enterprise is not just to flatten the curve, but to crush the curve and ultimately wipe out this pandemic\n",
      "assisting IU Health by making rooms available in Briscoe Quad in Bloomington to medical workers for respite care or to quarantine from their families. Likewise, we are also making rooms available in University Tower at IUPUI for similar reasons to house medical workers from IU Health and other area hospitals, and potentially to house COVID-19 patients. We have also donated 100,000 personal protective masks to IU Health, in light of the state's shortage of personal protective equipment\n",
      "also providing free, 24-hour, high-speed Wi-Fi access across the state to those who may not have internet connectivity due to the closure of libraries and businesses.

Over the last 22 years, IU has firmly cemented its stature as one of the most International universities in the nation, and the new mural reflects this in a montage that represents the university’s global engagement and in its depiction of new and planned facilities that support this engagement\n",

But the impetus behind all of this change has been the same: to provide our students with the best, most relevant educational opportunities possible so that they are well-positioned for success upon their graduation in today’s global workforce—and so that they are prepared to meet challenges and opportunities that arise here in Indiana, across the country, and around the world\n",
